##### A popular bottle of beer song, 09/18/15

#### By Archana Bongale
## Description
Program that takes as input the number of beers on the wall (an arbitrary number entered by the user).With this number as a starting point, the program will output the words to the seemingly endless Beer song:

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.

98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.

97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.

96 bottles of beer on the wall, 96 bottles of beer. Take one down and pass it around, 95 bottles of beer on the wall.

...on down to zero. At zero, the final line  read:

No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.
